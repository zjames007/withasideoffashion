5.0.6 - 2013-09-20 - Packaging Bot
	Updated lib/updater to version 1.0.3
5.0.7 - 2013-10-02 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Big rewrite to the updater in order to make the code more flexible. This improves compatibility with plugins that allow for remote updating of plugins and themes.
	The updater now supports providing changelog details for plugins and themes that have updates available. These details can be viewed by clicking the "View version **** details" link for the appropriate plugin or theme.
5.0.8 - 2013-10-04 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Enhancement: When releases with four version digits are released (such as 2.1.0.3), by default, the updater will not offer to update if just this last digit is updated. For instance, it will not automatically offer to update 2.1.0.1 to 2.1.0.3; rather, an automatic upgrade will become available when version 2.1.1 or greater is released. If you wish to force an update to these versions, you can add ithemes-updater-force-minor-update=1 to an admin page request (such as http://domain.com/wp-admin/index.php?ithemes-updater-force-minor-update=1) in order to force the updater make these releases available for an hour. If the update is not performed within the hour, the updater reverts back to default behavior.
	Bug Fix: Corrected source of the following error when updating: Download failed. SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details: error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
	Bug Fix: Corrected source of the following warning: Warning: require_once(/api.php) [function.require-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory
5.0.9 - 2013-10-07 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Bug Fix: Corrected another source of the following warning which occur immediate after updating the plugin or theme: Warning: require_once(/api.php) [function.require-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory
5.0.10 - 2013-10-28 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Enhancement: Added a "Quick Release Updates" setting to the bottom of the licensing page. Enabling this option allows the site to receive automatic update notices for product quick releases (releases that do not have automatic update support by default).
	Enhancement: Changed how the licensing page works on Multisite. Now it will appear at Settings > iThemes Licensing in the network admin Dashboard and at Settings > iThemes Licensing on sites when the current user is a network admin. This prevents exposing the licensing page to users that don't are not super users and thus should not be performing updates. As this update makes the functionality of the "Licensing Page Access" setting obsolete, the setting has been removed.
	Enhancement: Using the ithemes-updater-force-minor-update query string variable will now force a data flush, allowing any available quick release updates to appear instantly.
	Enhancement: Added "License" links to the Plugins and Themes pages for the Network Admin Dashboard of multisite installs.
5.0.11 - 2013-11-04 - Chris Jean
	Bug Fix: Corrected an issue that prevented Views from being loaded when using the Builder Setup page to load Layouts and Views from the theme.
	Bug Fix: For themes that do not use builder-responsive but do have builder-full-width-modules enabled, a minimum width is now applied to the Layout. This width matches the Layout width and prevents some styling issues on screens that are smaller than the Layout's width.
	Bug Fix: Fixed a warning that could occur when switching from a broken theme to a Builder theme.
	Bug Fix: Fixed a warning that could occur after using the Builder Setup page to load Layouts and Views from the theme.
5.0.12 - 2013-11-05 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Added the builder_get_responsive_stylesheet_files filter to allow for modifying the file names used to load responsive stylesheets, including removing them if desired. Example:
		function custom_filter_responsive_stylesheet_files( $files ) {
			// Just remove the style-mobile.css stylesheet.
			//unset( $files['style-mobile.css'] );
			
			// Remove all the responsive stylesheets.
			//$files = array();
			
			// Change style-mobile.css to mobile.css.
			//$files['mobile.css'] = $files['style-mobile.css'];
			//unset( $files['style-mobile.css'] );
			
			return $files;
		}
		add_filter( 'builder_get_responsive_stylesheet_files', 'custom_filter_responsive_stylesheet_files' );
5.0.13 - 2013-11-21 - Chris Jean
	Bug Fix: Fixed Extensions not being properly applied to specific category, tag, author, or custom post type Views.
5.0.14 - 2013-11-25 - Packaging Bot (lib/classes)
	Enhancement: Improved output of ITUtility::print_r() in WordPress 3.8.
	Enhancement: ITUtility::print_r() now indicates the number of array elements in collapsed arrays and identifies boolean values explicitly.
	Enhancement: Added the ability for ITForm::add_drop_down() to show divided lists.
	Bug Fix: Fixed depth cutoff of ITUtility::backtrace().
	Bug Fix: Fixed broken javascript in error message output. This bug prevented the error message from being collapsed by default, causing the screen to show the message at all times.
5.0.15 - 2013-11-25 - Chris Jean
	Enhancement: Improved editor styling when running WordPress 3.8.
	Bug Fix: An Extension applied via a specific View (such as a category-specific View) will now override an Extension applied by a generic View (such as a category View that applies to all categories).
	Bug Fix: Fixed how editing a specific View (such as a category-specific View) to a generic View (such as a category View that applies to all categories) would result in the original View remaining intact along with the new generic View.
	Bug Fix: Fixed bad label tags in the Image Module editor.
5.0.16 - 2013-12-02 - Packaging Bot (lib/classes)
	Enhancement: Added ITUtility::screen_icon() to allow for easily preparing code for the WordPress 3.8 release. It only runs the screen_icon() function when WordPress is older than 3.8, thus avoiding the deprecation notice.
	Bug Fix: Removed Javascript notices created by the tooltips.
	Bug Fix: Removed Javascript notices created by ITDialog thickboxes.
5.0.17 - 2013-12-13 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Enhancement: Recently updated plugins and themes no longer report that an update is available.
	Enhancement: Added alternate line styling to the listings on the licensing page.
	Enhancement: Products with iThemes in the name will now properly capitalize the name.

5.0.19 - 2013-12-18 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Bug Fix: Removed unneeded check on package-info.ithemes.com which was causing performance issues on some sites.
5.0.20 - 2013-12-19 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Bug Fix: Licensing will now be universal across all sites of a multisite network. This means that you will only need to license on one site to have the license apply across the entire network.
5.0.21 - 2014-01-23 - Packaging Bot (lib/classes)
	Bug Fix: Prior versions would fix non-https URL's for local content when the site was accessed via SSL so that the URL would become an https URL; however, it would not reverse the process and change https URL's to http when accessed without SSL. This caused problems on sites that use self-signed certificates and would sometimes have local content URL's that referred to the https location. This update makes the https URL's convert to http when the site is accessed via SSL.
5.0.22 - 2014-02-03 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Bug Fix: Licensing on SSL-enabled sites now works properly.

	Enhancement: Authenticating users now uses the new authentication system.
5.0.30 - 2015-03-24 - Chris Jean
	WordPress Compatibility: Added compatibility for new split terms in WordPress 4.2.
	Bug Fix: The Navigation Module now properly sorts Navigation Type setting options.
5.0.31 - 2015-04-23 - Packaging Bot (lib/updater)
	Compatibility Fix: Updated plugin and theme update data format to match changes in WordPress 4.2.
5.0.32 - 2015-06-29 - Packaging Bot (lib/classes)
	Security Fix: Fixed a potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) security hole caused by unsanitized inputs for resizing certain kinds of images and generating zip files. Exploiting this flaw would require third-party code or a privileged WordPress user. Thanks to Ryan Satterfield (http://planetzuda.com) for helping to identify this issue.
	Bug Fix: Fixed index.php files being added to the root of zip files created with ITZip.
	Enhancement: Improved the form-handling API to handle complex forms with nested groups.
	Enhancement: Better handling of non-ASCII, non-UTF8 characters in debug output.
5.0.33 - 2015-07-07 - Chris Jean

5.0.36 - 2015-10-27 - Chris Jean
