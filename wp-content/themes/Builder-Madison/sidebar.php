// Empty on purpose. Builder's rendering engine automatically handles rendering the sidebars and widget areas as needed.
// This file only exists to prevent calls to get_sidebar() from loading the default sidebar code built into WordPress core.
// Since this would result in additional sidebars being incorrectly being rendered, having this empty file is the way to avoid this.
